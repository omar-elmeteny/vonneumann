# Computer System Architecture (CSEN601) Project

## Package 3: Fillet-O-Neumann *with moves on the side*

The project simulates a fictional processor using the Von Neumann architecture. 

Von Neumann Architecture is a digital computer architecture whose design is based on the
concept of stored program computers where program data and instruction data are stored
in the same memory.

- Detailed project description in [docs/ProjectDescription.pdf](./docs/ProjectDescription.pdf)
- Java source files are in the [src](./src/) folder.
- Test Programs are in the [programs](./programs/) folder and include the following test programs:
    - **fill-mem.txt:** Writes the numbers from 0 to 1023 in memory addresses 1024 to 2047
    - **movi.txt:** Tests `MOVI` and `JMP` instructions
    - **one_plus_two.txt:** Adds 1 + 2 and stores the result in `R3`
    - **sum1-10.txt:** Sums the number from 1 to 10 and stores the result in `R1`
    - **table8.txt:** Multiples the numbers from 1 to 12 by 8 and store the results in address 2000 to 2011
    - **test.txt** Tests the functionality of various instructions.
- The program output is stored as HTML file in the [output](./output/) folder
